# Arrays 

This folder contains implementation of array-based data structures built from scratch.

## Implementations

- Dynamic Array 
    - append
    - insert
    - delete
    - pop 
    - resize (double capacity)
    - shrink (half capacity)
    - reverse() (in-place)
    - Encapsulation of internal storage (_array, _size)
    - __getitem__ for indexing
    - __setitem__ for assignment
    - __iter__ for iteration support
    - __len__ for length support
    - to_list() for safe data exposure

## Concepts covered

- Amortized O(1) time complexity
- Memory resizing strategy
- Element shifting
- Capacity vs Size distinction 
- Two-pointer technique
- Encapsulation
- Dunder methods
- Iterator protocol
