# DSA to AI Systems Engineering
A structured journey from core Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) to systems-level thinking and AI engineering.
This repository focuses on implementing fundamental data structures from scratch in Python with clean design, unit testing, and performance awareness.
The goal is to build deep understanding of how systems behave under the hood.
